# JavaScript Interactive Table
This JavaScript Interactive Table allows developers to display tabular data on "cards". Each card features a tooltip which toggles on and off as the table's "cards" are clicked.

An example of the table [can be found here](http://www.coronite.net/androidarchitecture.php), and screenshots of the desktop and mobile version are below:

The table is perfect for tutorials where both heirarchy and term definitions are important.

JavaScript Interactive Table is:
- Responsive
- Lightweight
- Made with Plain JavaScript

# Usage
The table can be added to an existing html file

The index.html file contains CSS within a `<style>` tag and JavaScript within a `<script>` tag. Both can easily be transfered to separate CSS and JavaScript files
